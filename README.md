# FRENZIED KUMA
Yes, indeed.
It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of Lords of Cinder converge.
In venturing north, the Pilgrims discover the truth, the old words: 

>The fire fades, and the Lords go without thrones.

When the link of Fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves.

- Aldrich, saint of the deep;
- Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers;
- And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant.

Only, in truth, the Lords will abandon their thrones.
And the Unkindled will rise.
**Nameless**, **accursed undead**, **unfit even to be cinder**.
And so it is, that Ash seeketh Embers.
